# PDForum

PDForum is a PDF-only social media website.

That's right. There's no HTML. No CSS. Just pure, static, dynamically-rendered PDFs.

## Why?

Because I can. What did you expect?

See [insecure-website](https://index-insecure.meow.i.ng/) (a website where all information is stored in the subdomain, meaning it's unencrypted even under HTTPS) for another pointless creation of mine.

## Isn't this insecure?
